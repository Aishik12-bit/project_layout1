# Fruit and Vegetable Detection and Analysis

This GitHub repository contains documentation and wireframes for a project that focuses on detecting and analyzing fruit and vegetable items. The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Freshness Detection**: Determine whether a fruit or vegetable item is fresh or not.
2. **Type and Origin Identification**: Identify the type and origin of a given fruit or vegetable item.
3. **Nutrient Analysis**: Provide nutrient contents and analysis of the detected food items.

## Introduction

The detection and analysis of fruit and vegetable items play a crucial role in the food industry, quality control, and health management. This project aims to leverage computer vision and machine learning techniques to accomplish various tasks related to fruit and vegetable analysis. By using image recognition algorithms, the system can detect the freshness, identify the type and origin, and provide nutrient contents of the scanned food items.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
```sh

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fruit-vegetable-detection.git

```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
```sh

    pip install -r requirements.txt

```

3. Additional steps, such as setting up a specific environment or downloading pre-trained models, might be required. Please refer to the [documentation](#documentation) for detailed instructions.

## Usage

Once the project is set up, you can use it as follows:
